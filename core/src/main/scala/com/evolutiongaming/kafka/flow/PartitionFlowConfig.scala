/** Configuration of `PartitionFlow`.
  *
  * Every poll request coming to `PartitionFlow` will cause the records processed
  * and the state updated. This is, often, a relatively lightweight operation
  * because only the keys for which records are coming in will be affected.
  *
  * However, `PartitionFlow` also needs to request Kafka commits, and trigger
  * timers from time to time. This, currently, requires touching all the keys
  * stored in the memory. This could be a heavyweight operation if there are
  * a lot of keys accumulated, and consume a lot of CPU resources.
  *
  * That why the operation is only peformed from time to time, not on ever
  * Kafka poll. Neverthless, if latency is more important than CPU resources
  * or it is not expected to have a lot of keys alive simultaniously, it
  * is perferctly fine to set these parameters to zero.
  *
  * @param triggerTimersInterval How often timers will be triggered if
  * there are timers to trigger.
  *
  * @param commitOffsetsInterval How often the state is to be evaluated
  * for the pending commits.
  *
  * @param parallelRecovery If `true` tries to recover the keys in parallel.
  * Note that it, currently, requires for all keys to fit in memory.
  *
  * @param commitOnRevoke Try commiting everything when partition is revoked.

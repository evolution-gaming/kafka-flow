      // The typical situation when it happens is when ConsumerRecord without
      // actual events inside of it comes, so the state is changed from `None`
      // to `None`.

      // This will cause the key to be deleted in `PartitionFlow`, but some
      // events applied after that causing the actual state to change from
      // `None` to `Some(_)` and this state will be lost, because the key
      // is already deleted from the cache.
      //
      // TODO: It is too unsafe to leave it like that. This will be partially
      // resolved by TECH-191, but, probably, we should do one of these things:
      // 1. Perform deletion only if `state` was `Some(_)` before that.
      // 2. Delay `KeyContext[F].remove` execution until the end of the batch
      //    inside of `PartitionFlow`.
      //
      // It makes me think that the initial implementation of returning `Done`
      // was not as bad as I thought.

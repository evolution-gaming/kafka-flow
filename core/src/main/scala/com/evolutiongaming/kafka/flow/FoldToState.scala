        // is already deleted from the cache.

        // TODO: It is too unsafe to leave it like that. This will be partially
        // resolved by TECH-191, but, probably, we should do one of these things:
        // 1. Perform deletion only if `state` was `Some(_)` before that.
        // 2. Delay `KeyContext[F].remove` execution until the end of the batch
        //    inside of `PartitionFlow`.

        // was not as bad as I thought.

    *   determines whether an incoming consumer record should be processed or skipped. Skipping a record means that (1)
    *   no state will be restored for that key; (2) no fold will be executed for that event. It doesn't affect
    *   committing consumer offsets, thus, even if all records in a batch are skipped, new offsets will still be
    *   committed if necessary
    * @param remapKey
    *   allows to remap the key of a record before it is processed by the flow. Remapping is done before the record is
    *   processed by the flow. Thus, the next steps in the flow (such as [[FilterRecord]] and [[FoldOption]]) will see
    *   the remapped key

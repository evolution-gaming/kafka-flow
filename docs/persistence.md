## Persistence modes
TBD.

## Compression
Kafka-flow has a built-in support for compressing application's state
when it's being persisted. This can be achieved by creating an instance of `Compressor`
and enhancing a user-defined instance of `ToBytes[F, State]` with it 
via a syntax extension. Additionally, you need to provide instances of 
`ToBytes` and `FromBytes` to encode/decode a `Header` which contains 
meta-information about compressed data.  

The example below illustrates the approach. Note that it's using a simplified
approach towards encoding both state and headers, and you may want to encode them
differently (as JSON for example).
```scala mdoc:silent
import cats.effect.IO
import com.evolutiongaming.kafka.flow.persistence.compression.{Compressor, Header}
import com.evolutiongaming.skafka.{FromBytes, ToBytes}
import com.evolutiongaming.kafka.flow.persistence.compression.CompressorSyntax._
import scodec.bits.BitVector
import scodec.codecs.{bool, int32}

// Application's state
final case class State(int: Int)

// Encoder of the application's state
val toBytes: ToBytes[IO, State] = (state, _) =>
  IO.fromTry(int32.encode(state.int).map(_.toByteArray).toTry)

// Encoder/decoder of metainformation header
implicit val headerToBytes: ToBytes[IO, Header] =
  (header, _) => IO.fromTry(bool.encode(header.compressed).map(_.toByteArray).toTry)
implicit val headerFromBytes: FromBytes[IO, Header] =
  (bytes, _) => IO.fromTry(bool.decode(BitVector(bytes)).map(result => Header(result.value)).toTry)
  
// Resulting instance can be passed to other parts of kafka-flow's API
for {
  compressor <- Compressor.of[IO](compressionThreshold = 10000)
  toBytesWithCompression = toBytes.withCompression(compressor)
} yield ()
```

### Compression metrics
`Compressor` can report metrics of a size of data before and after compression. Metrics support is available as a part 
of `FlowMetrics` API from `kafka-flow-metrics` module in form of `FlowMetrics#compressorMetrics(component)` 
where `component` is the name of the label that will be used for metrics of this compressor.  
The following metrics are reported:
  - `compressor_raw_bytes` - the size of state before compressing
  - `compressor_compressed_bytes` - the size of compressed state (including library-added meta-information)

Note: these metrics had a `_total` suffix in earlier versions. 
Starting with `prometheus-metrics` v1.0.0 this suffix is no longer allowed and has therefore been removed.
Users of `simpleclient` forked version `0.9.999-evo1` will see a change in the metric name, since the `_total` suffix is not automatically added in that version.

```scala mdoc:silent
import cats.effect.syntax.resource._
import com.evolutiongaming.kafka.flow.FlowMetrics
import com.evolutiongaming.kafka.flow.metrics.syntax._
import com.evolutiongaming.smetrics.CollectorRegistry

val registry: CollectorRegistry[IO] = CollectorRegistry.empty[IO]
for {
  flowMetrics <- FlowMetrics.of(registry)
  compressor <-
    Compressor
      .of[IO](compressionThreshold = 10000)
      .map(_.withMetrics(flowMetrics.compressorMetrics("settlement")))
      .toResource
  toBytesWithCompression = toBytes.withCompression(compressor)
} yield ()
```

### Backward compatibility
To support smooth transition from raw state to using compression, the library implementation of `Compressor` tries
to detect if the byte array it tries to decompress starts with an opening curly bracket(`{`). In this case it makes
an assumption that you keep the state in JSON and the particular byte array is in a raw format (without compression) 
and doesn't attempt to decompress the byte array, returning it as-is.  
Please note that it's going to work **only** if the application's state was encoded as JSON before!
